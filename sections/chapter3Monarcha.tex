\chapter{Selective sweeps on different pigmentation genes mediate convergent evolution of island melanism in two incipient bird species}

\textit{Content of this chapter was published in PLoS Genetics (2022) under the title "Selective sweeps on different pigmentation genes mediate convergent evolution of island melanism in two incipient bird species" by Leonardo Campagna, Ziyi Mo, Adam Siepel and J. Albert C. Uy. L.C. conceptualized the study, curated data, performed formal analyses, developed methodology and wrote the manuscript. Z.M. characterized selective sweeps in the bird populations using the SIA method, developed methodology and edited the manuscript. A.S. developed methodology and edited the manuscript.
