\chapter{Conclusions and Perspectives} \label{chapter5}

\section{Summary}

% Rich opportunities to move forward with this line of work
% for example, explainable ML model, existing work (highlighted in \cite)
% below, elaborate on exciting new area at its infancy in popgen, in light of recent success in a variety of other domains

\section{Evolutionary modeling in the era of generative \ac{AI}} \label{evo-genAI}

%% survey of previous generative DL models: RBM, GAN, VAE
%% introduce existing body of work in popgen
%% 1. non-differentiability problem
%% explain the need for pre-trained models
%% 2. auto-regressive training, "threading" cf. intro

%% promising way to circle back to the original pursuit. The future might be in the past.
